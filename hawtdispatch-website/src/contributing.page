## Improving the documentation

Documentation is massively important to help users make the most of {project_name:} and it is probably the area that needs the most help!

## If you find a bug or problem

Please raise a new issue in our <a href="{project_issue_url:}">Issue Tracker</a>. If you can create a JUnit test case then your issue is more likely to be resolved quicker.
